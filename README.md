# OOF_Console_App
This is an on-going project for class COP 3003 using C++.

### Features
* Trivia-style console game
  * Has three simple questions from separate genres: Animal, Trivia, and Math
* Point system
  * The point system is not objective (there's no real system for how points are assigned)
  * The points will be later used for the user to receive specific responses
  
### Project Status
It has been updated for Milestone 2, but more work is expected to make it more user friendly.
  
### Sources
This app derives inspirations from several sites, such as:
LearnCPP, Geeks for Geeks, and W3Schools.
