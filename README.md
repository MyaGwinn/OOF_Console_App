# OOF_Console_App
This is the final project for class COP 3003 using C++. OOF stands for Original Ostentatious Fault-finder and this program is to act as a trivia-style console game. At this moment, OOF includes three simple questions from separate genres, including Animal, Trivia, and Math. There is also a standardized point system and these points are planned to be used later for the user to receive specific answer choice responses. This was made independently and last updated on 12/14/2021. For coding, the skill proficiency exhibited is on-par with someone who has experience with coding in general but can still use further training specifically for C++.
### Demonstration

### Documentation
[Doxygen](https://myagwinn.github.io/OOF_Console_App/)

### Getting Started
Download OOF_Console_App.sln to begin! Once downloaded, run on Visual Studio 2019 and click 'Local Windows Debugger'. As seen in the GIF above, the introduction prompt should pop up.

### Built With
Microsoft Visual Studio, which I have several years of experience with, due to my classes. Visual Studio has been used for Python, Java, C++, and C#.

### Contributing
